Using metadata programmatically:

- Easier to extend when new years or variables are added.

- Reduces copy-paste errors and inconsistencies.

- Centralizes all variable naming/harmonization logic in one CSV.

Hard-coding variable names:

- Faster to set up for a tiny dataset.

- But very error-prone and harder to maintain.

- Any change in variable names or more years requires editing the code.
